Words! Tehy are what we use to communicate via speaking and writing, and reading. Apostrophes are used. Bob's tail is used by the cook's wife's friend. All the cooks are making cakes on the dishes. They cooked and baked all the stuff. The cooker is a baker, and the "things" are in "quotes". Cooking and baking are similar things. They always make deliciously, decidedly scrumptious treats. Don't be fooled. Sometimes people such as Bakers capitalized the words incorrectly.

Now we have a predicament. We may need to take a siesta after all this talk of staying in malconduct-like motels. It is time to upraise the system, quit the touchstone and substantiate our Royce ovenbird. Just tested the elements farther down in the lists.

End.
